2. Download this repository and cd into it
3. On your terminal, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages necessary to using this program
4. To create and train the model, execute `python trainbrain.py train test model.h5` and wait for training to complete.
    When prompted, confirm if you want to save the model or not.
The model is now setup and ready for use.
# Usage
1. Obtain the image you would like to get a diagnosis of and load it onto your computer
2. To execute the diagnosis program, run `python braindiagnosis.py model.h5 [YOUR_IMAGE_HERE]`, replacing `[YOUR_IMAGE_HERE]` with the path to your image.
The program will then output its diagnosis.
